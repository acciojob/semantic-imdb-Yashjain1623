	"Inception" follows Dom Cobb, a skilled thief who specializes in stealing secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state. Cobb is approached by a wealthy businessman, Saito, who offers him a chance to have his criminal record erased in exchange for performing an "inception" - planting an idea into the mind of a powerful CEO through their dreams. Cobb assembles a team and ventures into multiple layers of dreams, navigating through a complex maze of memories and subconscious projections while facing his own inner demons. As the mission progresses, Cobb grapples with his past and struggles to distinguish between reality and the dream world, leading to a mind-bending and emotionally charged climax.
